# WORKING WITH EYEDEA 101 

Our collaboration is based on these fundamentals: 

- Transparency
- Cooperation
- Team play

This is a schema of our typical product development project. It’s inspired by the launch list of NASA’s countdown procedure for rockets 🚀

## Before the project (3-5 days)

- 📅 Initial meeting (1-2h) - project scope & needs description
- 📦 Send us all specifications / files / designs - everything that might be useful 
- ⏳ Project estimation (3-5 days) -  we may ask some questions to have a better understanding of the product
- 📩 E-mail message with our vision of your product development with some numbers 


## FINAL GO / NO-GO

At this point both sides need to decide if we’re starting the cooperation. 

- 📅 Decision meeting (1-2h)

If *GO* - agreement, type of cooperation (time & material / fixed price), start date, goto: Project kickoff 🚀

If *NO-GO* - see you next time! 👋


## Project kickoff 🚀 (start date)

Let's do this!

- #️⃣ Slack channel setup - all communication goes there - main rule: **don't use private messages** 
- 📅 Team & project introduction meeting (1h)
- 🛠 Tools access / setup - both sides provide list of people & tools (accounts are created if needed)


## Project 

During the product development you'll get: 

- 📩 weekly summary of project progress with hour reports and most interesting updates (single e-mail)
- 💻 access to designs & code
- ⏰ access to hour reports

### Your duties

As we're going together towards the goal of making the project, we'll need your presence sometimes.
