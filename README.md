# WORKING WITH EYEDEA 101 

Our collaboration is based on these fundamentals: 

- Transparency
- Cooperation
- Team play

The document you're reading is a schema of our typical product development project. It is inspired by the launch list of NASA's countdown procedure for rockets 🚀.

## Before the project (3-5 days)

- 📅  Initial meeting (1-2h) - project scope & needs description
- 📦  Send us all specifications/files/designs - everything that might be useful - hello@eyedea.io
- ⏳  Project estimation (3-5 days) -  we may ask some questions to have a better understanding of the product
- 🧑‍🚀  Crew selection 
- 📩  E-mail message with our vision of your product development with some numbers 


## FINAL GO / NO-GO

At this point, both sides need to decide if we're starting the cooperation. 

- 📅  Decision meeting (1-2h)

If *GO* - agreement, type of cooperation (time & material / fixed price), start date, go to Project kickoff 🚀

If *NO-GO* - see you next time! 👋


## Project kickoff 🚀 (start date)

Let's do this!

- #️⃣  Slack channel setup - all communication goes there - main rule: ** don't use private messages** 
- 📅  Team & project introduction meeting (1h)
- 🛠  Tools access/setup - both sides provide a list of people & tools (we're creating accounts if needed)


## Project 

During the product development you'll get: 

- 📩  weekly summary of project progress with hour reports and most exciting updates (single e-mail)
- 💻  access to designs & code
- ⏰  access to hour reports

### Tools & methods

We're building things with our method called Flow. It's scenarios based way of describing your product, and it's understandable by every team member (including you). We're happy to tell you more about it - don't hesitate to ask!
