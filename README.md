# WORKING WITH EYEDEA 101 

Our collaboration is based on these fundamentals: 

- Transparency
- Cooperation
- Team play

This is a schema of our typical product development type of work. Itâ€™s inspired by the launch list of NASAâ€™s countdown procedure for rockets ðŸš€

## Before the project

- ðŸ“… Initial meeting (1-2h) 
- ðŸ“¦ Send us all specifications / files / designs - everything that might be useful 

## FINAL GO / NO-GO

At this point both sides need to decide if weâ€™re starting the cooperation. 

- ðŸ“… Decision meeting (1-2h)

If *GO* - agreement, type of cooperation (time & material / fixed price) 
If *NO-GO* - see you next time!


## Project kickoff ðŸš€

- Slack channel setup - all communication goes there - main rule: don't use private messages 


## After project

- ðŸ“… Project retro
